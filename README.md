# Bouncy Ball Physics Simulation ðŸŽ¾

An interactive physics-based project built with **Swift, SwiftUI, and SpriteKit** for my Advanced Swift final.  
This app simulates a ball that bounces around the screen with realistic gravity and collisions against moveable objects.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Realistic ball physics
- Dynamic collision detection using SpriteKit.
- Moveable obstacles that can be dragged and repositioned in real time.
- Clean SwiftUI interface integrated with the physics engine.
